# forgor.io
This will be a to do application which actually has the features that I need, in an accessible, simple, and quick-to-setup manner.

### What should be different?
Many todo applications exist, but integration between these apps and the various other services that I like to use can be quite annoying to setup, or even impossible. An example of this is the integration of tasks with deadlines and sceduling on my various calendars, namely Google Calendar and Outlook. While there are potentially many apps that support this, they generally lack the simplicity and portability that I require to actually integrate it into my daily life. I would also really enjoy being able to keep proper notes, images, etc... along with each task. A producitivity application which requires wasting a couple hours here and there in order to actually aid productivity is not doing its job (this is the case for my favorite productivity app: Notion). forgor.io will address that.

### General Feature Requirements:
- Adding tasks
  - The default layout should be a basic task lisk similar to Microsoft To Do
- Adding deadlines to tasks
- Creating Projects
  - Projects will be customizable boards (similar to Trello) vs the default task list format
- Creating Teams
- Assigning team members/collaborators to tasks
- Multiple calendar and email integrations
- Adding 'schedules' to tasks
  - Schedules will be periods of time that should be dedicated to certain tasks
- Adding numeric priorty to tasks 
- Logging in and signing up with popular services like Google, Microsoft, and Github.
- and more to come...
